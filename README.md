# beacon_ww3_eject_simulator

This repo simulates the effects of the inactivity leak on big networks. Initially I attempted to run this on a jupyter notebook, but for 1M indices each simulation took 1 hour ðŸ« . Rust is a bit faster to do math, taking ~45 seconds per simulation. Plotting sucks, but it's okay.

### `EJECTION_BALANCE = 16`
